# Development Strategy



| _Step Name_ | User Story | Changes in HTML | Changes in CSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __Navigation Bar__ | Well I added the navigation bar, in my case I create a separate folder called "pages" and inside I will place the other pages | An empty template project with `doctype`, language, charset, `head` & `body` | an empty file |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Showcase__ | add the showcase because is the second part of the website | The block "showcase" was added | an empty file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __Newsteller and Boxes__ | Thge next logic is to add the next 2 parts that follow the tutorial | Add `section` Newsteller and Box, plus created the `class` box | an empty file |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Footer1__ | the end of the website  | Added the `footer` elements | an empty file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __CSS file__ | Added the CSS, this was made before upload on VSC,  everything was made base on the tutorial | no changes | Add the entire CSS, this includes the inner pages |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Add Images folder__ | Forgot to add the images folder, however the more important was to see the working site | No add to the html5 only the images that were missing | no changes |
